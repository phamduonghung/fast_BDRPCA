(Fast High Resolution Blood Flow Estimation and Clutter Rejection via an Alternating Optimization Problem)

This paper introduces a computationally efficient technique for estimating high-resolution Doppler blood flow from an ultrafast ultrasound image sequence. More precisely, it consists in a new fast alternating minimization algorithm that implements a blind deconvolution method based on robust principal component analysis. Numerical investigation carried out on in vivo data shows the efficiency of the proposed approach in comparison with state-of-the-art methods
